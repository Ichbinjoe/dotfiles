# Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles. They are not based on anyone else's dotfiles.
They are designed to be super simple, and just symlink lots of things to other
places in a nice and neat fashion. To use, clone this repo somewhere and run
`./install.sh`. These dotfiles take advantage of the following software:

+ Zsh / Oh-My-Zsh
+ Tmux
+ NVim

It is assumed these are installed. There is only a dependency on bash to run
the install script.
